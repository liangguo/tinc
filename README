About tinc 2.0
--------------

Compared to older versions of tinc, the security will be improved. This version
will use the TLS protocol to set up connections between tinc daemons. Not only
is this more secure than our own protocol we used in former versions of tinc,
it also allows, thanks to the GNUTLS library, different ways to authenticate:

- X.509 certificates allow trust to be governed by a certificate authority,
  ideal when trust is to be managed centrally.

- OpenPGP certificates allow trust to be done in a peer-to-peer way, ideal when
  there is no central authority.

- SRP allows a tinc daemon to authenticate itself with a username and password.
  Ideal for a client/server setup.

Furthermore, tinc will be split into a few components. The "tincd" from 1.0
will remain, but will purely be a daemon that runs in the backgrounds and that
manages a peer-to-peer VPN. A "tinc" binary will be used to set up, configure,
start/stop and monitor a running tincd. A tinc client daemon will be created
that will only be able to connect to one other tincd, thereby greatly
simplifying it, but will have features added that are interesting for clients,
for example pulling configuration from a tincd. There will also be one or more
GUI versions of the tinc binary.

Tinc 2.0 will not be compatible with older versions.
