Before you can start compiling tinc from a clean Subversion checkout, you have
to install the very latest versions of the following packages:

- GNUTLS
- Gcrypt
- LZO
- libevent
- GCC
- automake
- autoconf
- gettext

Then you have to let the autotools create all the autogenerated files, using
this command:

autoreconf -f -s -i

If you change configure.ac or any Makefile.am file, you will have to rerun
autoreconf. After this, you can run configure and make as usual. To create a
tarball suitable for release, run:

make dist

To clean up your working copy so that no autogenerated files remain, run:

make svn-clean
